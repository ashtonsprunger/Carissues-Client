# Getting started with Carissues

Carissues is a tool to help car buyers and owners research and post issues that you and other people have had with that car. You can find the site [HERE](https://findcarissues.herokuapp.com).

## Layout

The left third of the screen is you account. It will show you the login status as well as the issues you've posted. The right two thirds of the screen is the main section. It is where you will spend most of your time.

## Querying

At the very top of the page, there are two dropdowns, one to select the make of the car you would like to search for, and one to select the model. Select the make and model, the press the 'Search' botton. if you leave the make selector at '--All--', you will see all of the issues. if you select a make and leave the model selector at '--All--', you will see all of the issues for the given make regardless of the model.

## Posting an Issue

You must have an account to post. If you don't, click 'Register' and create one! Otherwise, login. Now click 'Post an issue'. fill out the make, model, and if you want, the year! Now, in the title section, write an overview of the issue. (most likely 3-10 words) Now in the issue section, describe your issue with great detail! This will help other people know if they have the solution or not. Click 'Post!' and you're done!

## Editing and Deleting

When logged in, your issues will have an 'edit', and 'delete' button. The 'edit' button allows you to edit the issue, pretty self explanatory. just change the fields if needed and press 'Update!'. Deleting is just a matter of pressing 'delete' and confirming it.

## Fixes

Fixes appear under the issues in a dropdown. To post just type a fix in the text box and press 'Post!'. The 'edit' and 'delete' buttons work the same as with the issues.
